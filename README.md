# tennis-kata
A kata focussed on parsing the scores of tennis matches provided in a game-by-game format (e.g. AABAAABA) from a textual input file, and outputting them in a standard tennis score format (6-2).

The intention with this piece of code was to keep things simple in terms of structure, hence only using the single class. I'm content with some duplication to handle Player A and Player B clearly. It could be avoided but I think it can often be tempting to over-refactor code, which can actually make the code less readable.
